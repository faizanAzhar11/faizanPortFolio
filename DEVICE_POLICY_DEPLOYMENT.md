# ðŸš€ Command Line Deployment - Device Policy Workaround

## âœ… What We've Successfully Done Via Command Line:

```powershell
# 1. Built the project successfully
npm run build

# 2. Created deployment package
Compress-Archive -Path "out\*" -DestinationPath "portfolio-deployment.zip" -Force
```

**Result**: Your portfolio is now ready for deployment! 
- âœ… Build completed successfully
- âœ… Static files generated in `out/` folder
- âœ… Deployment package created: `portfolio-deployment.zip` (646 KB)

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Your Deployment (Choose One Option):

### Option 1: Azure Portal Manual Upload (Fastest)
1. **Go to Azure Portal**: https://portal.azure.com
2. **Create Static Web App**:
   - Click "Create a resource" â†’ "Static Web App"
   - Choose "Other" as source (not GitHub for now)
   - Fill details:
     - Name: `faizan-portfolio`
     - Location: `East US`
     - Plan: `Free`
3. **Upload your files**:
   - Extract `portfolio-deployment.zip`
   - Upload contents via Azure Portal interface

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Fix (Best Long-term)
1. **Create Static Web App with GitHub Integration**:
   - Portal â†’ Static Web App â†’ Create
   - Source: GitHub
   - Repository: `faizanAzhar11/faizanPortFolio`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build preset: Custom
   - App location: `/`
   - Output location: `out`

2. **This will automatically**:
   - Generate deployment token
   - Add it to GitHub secrets
   - Fix the GitHub Actions workflow

### Option 3: Alternative Hosting (Quick Deploy)
Since you have the build ready, you can also deploy to:

```powershell
# Deploy to Netlify (if you have Netlify CLI)
netlify deploy --prod --dir out

# Deploy to Vercel (if you have Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod --yes

# Deploy to Surge.sh (simple static hosting)
npm install -g surge
cd out
surge . your-domain.surge.sh
```
